Code0 is an experimental x86 interactive disassembler. It understands 32-bit and 16-bit code, disassembles EXE, COM and arbitrary binaries. Performs fully modelling of an address space of disassembled application. Allows for dynamic interactive disassembling. Parses imports and exports of an executable, can also make dump of a running process with all DLLs, and parse all of them in united address space.

It was written in 2008 when I was writing pretty bad, so don't expect great code style :) Nevertheless, there are some interesting ideas and tricks.
